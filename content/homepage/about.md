**Hi there!** I'm `Arindam Ghosh`, a computer vision researcher passionate about applying AI in healthcare. My interests revolve around the intersection of computer vision and medical imaging. I've led a global team to the top 30 in NASA Space Apps, spoke at NASA TOPS 2023, and organized the BIST-MMRES Scihack in Spain. Our team also won the Smart Indian Hackathon 2022 for ISRO.

Outside of work (when I am not procrastinating from it), I like to explore new places, getting geeky about gadgets or trying to fit "learn to swim" and "learn to play piano" in my schedule.
