{{< highlight "Research Experience">}}

#### - PIC – Port d’Informació Científica , UAB, Barcelona, Spain (May 2023 - July 2023)
- **Neural spike detection in retina microscopy**
  
  Supervisor: Dr. Martin Børstad Eriksen, PIC, UAB, Barcelona.
  > I was part of a collaborative research project between VHIR, ICFO, and PIC, which focuses on exploring
the effects of photoreceptor restoration therapies. Specifically, my work involved an exploratory analysis
of potential spike detection techniques for light sheet microscopy images of organoids. Finding such
techniques would enable a more detailed 3D analysis of retina activity, contributing to the understanding
of the impact of photoreceptor restoration therapies.


#### - Institut de Fisica d’Altes Energies (IFAE), Barcelona, Spain (Oct 2022 - July 2023)
- **Optimizing Proton Tracking and Energy Determination for Improved Proton CT Imaging**

  Supervisor: Dr. Pillar Casado and Dr. Throsten Lux, IFAE-BIST.
  >I was involved in developing an algorithm that utilizes image processing and machine learning techniques
to reconstruct the energy of protons by analyzing their trajectories through a range detector, thus
optimizing Proton Tracking and Energy Determination for Improved Proton CT (pCT) Imaging.

#### - Amity University- Noida, India (Oct 2021 - Jan 2022)
- **Brain Tumor MRI classification using deep learning**

  Supervisor: Professor Sanjeev Thakur, HoD-CSE, ASET
  >I used different feature descriptors like Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to extract features from MRI images using OTSU thresholding. I finetuned all layers of the transfer learning models like VGG-16, Resnet-18, Densenet-121 to get better classification rate.

#### - Amity University- Noida, India (Jun 2021 - Sept 2021)
- **Review of Brain tumor segmentation methods**

  Supervisor: Professor Sanjeev Thakur, HoD-CSE, ASET
  >I did a comparative study of different Machine Learning and Computer Vision methods used for Brain
Tumor Segmentation. The Brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) challenge dataset from 2012 to 2020 was
used on the models being compared. I provided an overall workflow, comparison of different models
and an assessment of the existing research literature with corresponding future advancements.

#### - Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India (Jun 2019 - Nov 2019)
- **Comparative study of HEp-2 Cells classification using dictionary learning**

  Supervisor: Professor Pradipta Maji, Machine Intelligence Unit
  >It was a comparative study of different discriminating Dictionary Learning methods. Algorithms like
Sparse Representation based classification, Label consistent K-SVD 1, Label consistent K-SVD 2 and
Fisher Discriminant Dictionary Learning were tested by classifying the MIVIA HEp-2 cells staining
pattern image database with different feature descriptors.


#### - Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, India (Jan 2019 - Apr 2019)
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to Denoise images**

  Supervisor: Professor Ajit Kumar, HoD-Mathematics department

used to train a GAN model and denoise images.


#### - Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, India (Nov 2018 - Dec 2018)
- **Forex Forecasting Using Support Vector Machines in Python**

  Supervisor: Professor Ajit Kumar, HoD-Mathematics department
  > I achieved an in-depth mathematical understanding of SVC, SVR and Kernels by implementing a
forecasting model on Forex currency pairs. Subsequently, I presented a comparison of different kernels
on SVR with Linear Regression.


#### - Indian Institute of Technology (IITB)-Bombay, India  (May 2017 - Jun 2017)
