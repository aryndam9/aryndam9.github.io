      <description>I designed and developed a configureable 4-channel DDR LVDS Serialized AXI FPGA interface in SystemVerilog (up to 250MHz) for time-digital-converter application on an Xilinx Zynq SoC. The TDC was interfaced to the FPGA SoM that I designed. In addition to the FPGA interface, I also developed the kernel and user-space drivers for accessing/debugging the interface and TDC from the SoC Linux environment. To leverage full speed data transfers of the FPGA interface I designed, a AXI to USB 3.</description>

In addition to the FPGA interface, I also developed the kernel and user-space drivers for accessing/debugging the interface and TDC from the SoC Linux environment.
To leverage full speed data transfers of the FPGA interface I designed, a AXI to USB 3.0 SuperSpeed interface was designed to stream the serialized TDC datastream to a downstream computer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I was heavily involved in the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab (PolySat) during my undergraduate. While working there for 4 years, I have worked on many CubeSat missions in a variety of roles throughout various mission lifetimes. I list out my accomplishmets and various projects below. I also interned at JPL, working on the MarCO CubeSat which was highly relavent to my experience at the Cal Poly CubeSat Lab.
